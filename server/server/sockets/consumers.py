"""
When a user posts a message, a JavaScript function will transmit 
the message over WebSocket to a ChatConsumer. The ChatConsumer 
will receive that message and forward it to the group corresponding 
to the room name. Every ChatConsumer in the same group (and thus in the same room) 
will then receive the message from the group and forward it over 
WebSocket back to JavaScript, where it will be appended to the chat log.

Several parts of the new ChatConsumer code deserve further explanation:

    - self.scope["url_route"]["kwargs"]["room_name"]
            Obtains the 'room_name' parameter from the URL route in 
            chat/routing.py that opened the WebSocket connection to 
            the consumer.

            Every consumer has a scope that contains information 
            about its connection, including in particular any positional 
            or keyword arguments from the URL route and the currently 
            authenticated user if any.

    - self.room_group_name = f"chat_{self.room_name}"

            Constructs a Channels group name directly from the
              user-specified room name, without any quoting or escaping.

            Group names may only contain alphanumerics, hyphens, 
            underscores, or periods. Therefore this example code 
            will fail on room names that have other characters.

    - async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_add)(...)

            Joins a group.

            The async_to_sync(...) wrapper is required because 
            ChatConsumer is a synchronous WebsocketConsumer but it 
            is calling an asynchronous channel layer method. 
            (All channel layer methods are asynchronous.)

            Group names are restricted to ASCII alphanumerics, 
            hyphens, and periods only and are limited to a maximum 
            length of 100 in the default backend. Since this code constructs 
            a group name directly from the room name, it will fail 
            if the room name contains any characters that arenâ€™t 
            valid in a group name or exceeds the length limit.

    - self.accept()

            Accepts the WebSocket connection.
            If you do not call accept() within the connect() method 
            then the connection will be rejected and closed. You might 
            want to reject a connection for example because the requesting 
            user is not authorized to perform the requested action.

            It is recommended that accept() be called as the last 
            action in connect() if you choose to accept the connection.

    - async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_discard)(...)

            Leaves a group.

    - async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_send)
            Sends an event to a group.
            An event has a special 'type' key corresponding to the name 
            of the method that should be invoked on consumers that receive 
            the event. This translation is done by replacing . with _, 
            thus in this example, chat.message calls the chat_message method.
